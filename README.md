Area is 200x170

3 variants = 40, 70, 100 houses

Assignment

a) Create a ground plan to maximize the total prize of all houses for the new neighborhood.

b) In addition to houses 20% of the area needs to consists of surface water. At most 4 different bodies of water may be added each with at least a side ratios of 1:4, thinner strips of surface water are not allowed. Water counts as clearance. Create a ground plan to maximize the total prize.

c) Because Amstelhaege needs to be a family friendly neighborhood the district wants to include playgrounds and make sure these are easily accessible for every house in the region. A playground is 30×20 meters and should be placed in such a way that each house is no more than 50 meters away. A playground does not count as clearance. A playground costs € 500 000,- and you may place as many as you want. Create a ground plan to maximize the total prize.

Advanced

d) Find the optimal number of houses (with and without playgrounds) if no restrictions hold for the numbers per type. That is, any type can be used or not.
